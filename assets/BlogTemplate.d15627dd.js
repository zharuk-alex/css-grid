I\u2019ve got a Polaroid hanging on my wall that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it\u2019s something I can touch, but it\u2019s stuck in the square between the borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I can\u2019t get back to the places we were </p><blockquote data-v-492e1dd9><p data-v-492e1dd9>You\u2019ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.</p></blockquote><p data-v-492e1dd9> &quot;You\u2019ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.

You keep pouring yourself out, again and again, into legible lines through a crooked pen.&quot; Yeah, it\u2019s painful, but it\u2019s familiar \u2013 so habit breeds comfort, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him </p><div class="tip tip-left" data-v-492e1dd9><p data-v-492e1dd9> You can listen to this song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvpej9TT-g" data-v-492e1dd9>YouTube</a></p></div><p data-v-492e1dd9> So in the early morning, when you\u2019ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I\u2019ve claimed as my own, and wonder if tonight will be a night I\u2019ll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all </p><p data-v-492e1dd9> In a perfect world, we\u2019ll have albums labeled Seasons, with chapter headings, and we\u2019ll staple them to the cork-board that hangs at the foot of the bed.
